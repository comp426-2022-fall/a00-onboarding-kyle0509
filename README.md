# Lab 0
The goal of this lab is to get comfortable with the basic conventions of circuit diagrams such as: power, ground, wires, mechanical switch, and light emitting diode (LED). At the end, you should be comfortable with:
- Working with Github Desktop,
- designing and testing simple circuits using the Digital software application, and 
- submitting your solution to Gradescope.

## 1. Github Desktop

Throughout this semester, you will be responsible for managing (cloning & committing) to your Github repositories so they can be linked to Gradescope for assignment submission and grading. Instead of using git commands in a terminal, we strongly recommend you to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). 

The links below provide step-by-step intructions along with visual aids about how to use Github Deskop:
* [Install](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) GitHub Desktop.
* [Authenticate](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github) to GitHub.
* [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) a repository from GitHub to GitHub Desktop.
* [Commit](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project) your changes to the repository.
* [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github) your changes to the repository. 

## 2. Digital: Circuit design and simulation software

Follow the instructions on the [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) GitHub page for downloading and running the software program (no installation required). In short, you simply download the .zip file, unzip it, and run the software. **Note:** A Java Runtime Environment (at least JRE 8) is required to run Digital.

To start Digital on **Windows** simply double click the provided `Digital.exe` executable file. To start Digital on **Mac** and **Linux** open a terminal and then execute the provided `Digital.sh` shell script from the command-line. 

Within Digital, you can access a useful help document by clicking **Help > Documentation**. We recommend reading:
- `Section 1`: How to navigate through the program and create simple circuits. 
- `Secion 3.2`: LED with two connections.
- `Sections 6.1 and 6.2`: Ground and voltage supply or **power**.
- `Section 13.1`: Mechanical on/off switch.

## 3. Circuit Design

Using Digital, we'll wire up a very simple circuit that uses power, ground, one or more switches, and one LED. In general, when the switch is closed the LED will turn on (color will be red) and when the switch is open the LED will be turned off (color will be black). Adding an LEDs a great way to visually test the output of your circuit.

First, clone the Lab 0 repository using the **clone** Github Desktop instructions provided above.

## 3.a First circuit

**TODO:** After cloning the Github repository for Lab 0, start Digital and open the file `Lab00a.dig`. You do not need to edit this circuit in any way, it serves simply as an example of what a completed circuit in Digital looks like. Use this file to familiarize yourself with the Digital software. For example, pressing the `play` button in the top right corner of the Digital software will allow you to simulate the circuit. Try flipping the switch and seeing how it affects the output of the LED. Inspect carefully how the LED is wired, notice which components represent power (logic 1) and which represent ground (logic 0). When you press the `play` button, certain wires will light up, these wires are the ones that are connected to power. Understanding and analyzing how this circuit works will be crucial to being able to complete the second part of this lab.


**What to submit?** There is nothing to "submit" for this part of the lab. Just make sure the `Lab00a.dig` file is still included in your repository when you submit on Gradescope. However please note, if you do not spend enough time on this section of the lab understanding how the circuit diagraming works, you will not be able to complete the second part of this lab.

## 3.b Slight enhancement to first circuit

This part is just a slight enhancement of the circuit in Section 3. We'll modify our circuit to act as a kind of **“mechanical AND gate,”** where the LED will only turn on if two switches are both in the **closed** position. This is simply wiring two switches in series, not using any **AND** gates (or indeed any logic gates at all). 

The one complication in this part of the lab is that we want to wire the two switches in such a way that the LED will only turn on when both switches are in the closed position. This will require some small modification to the switch wiring: one switch will need to select between ground and the output of the previous switch.

There is one important step you must take while constructing Digital circuits for this class. Every time you place a switch, you must right-click (control + click for Mac) the switch. This will open an options menu for the switch, where among other things, you can label the component. You will notice that all components are already labeled for you. For **both** switches that are placed in this circuit for you, go to the "advanced" options menu, and make sure you check the box labeled "Switch behaves like an input". This will allow the autograder to work. If you don't do this step, the autograder will not work! **Remember, you must enable this option for every switch in your circuit, and this step must be done in all future Digital labs as well!**

**TODO:** Construct your design in Digital using `Lab00b.dig` file as a start. You should only need to add wires and delete wires, not add any additional components. Verify that your design works in Digital by using the `play` button to simulate the circuit. You should only see the LED light up when both switches are in the closed position. 

**What to submit?** After modifying the file `Lab00b.dig` in order to implement the functionality shown above, you should commit and push your changes to your Lab 0 Github Repo.

## 4. Submit your assignment
Assignment submissions will be made through [GradeScope](https://www.gradescope.com).

You should already be enrolled in the COMP 311 Fall 2022 course on GradeScope. If you are not, please self enroll with the entry code **Y77WPX**. If you're unable to self enroll, please contact your cohort leader and we'll manually add you.

To submit your assignment, please follow the basic steps provided below. If you're unable to perform any of the steps, please reach out to your **cohort** and **cohort leader** as soon as possible. That is, give yourself time to resolve any technical issues using Github, Github Desktop, and Gradescope well before the assignment due date.

1. Submit modifications using the **commit** Github Desktop instructions provided above.
2. Update remote (origin) repository using the **push** Github Desktop instructions provided above.
3. Go to the COMP 311 course in GradeScope and click on the assignment called **Lab 00**.
